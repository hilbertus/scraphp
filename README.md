# scraphp
Scrape your data like you would do it with the help of jQuery in browsers console. 
This means pages with dynamic content are no longer a problem. It is up to you to transfer the data in desired formats 
or collect the data for later processing. 

## Install
1. Download or clone scraphp. Alternatively install with composer `composer require "hilbertus/scraphp"`
2. Download [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (default webdriver server for this project. After downloading, start `phantomjs  --webdriver=8910`)

## Get started

Look in *tests/functional/ScraphpTest.php*
